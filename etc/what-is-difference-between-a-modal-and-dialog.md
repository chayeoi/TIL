# What's the difference between a modal and dialog?

A Dialog or Dialog Box is a type of UI that speaks to the user and requests for the user's response. User could opt to ignore or dismiss the message.

Example: If you have uncommitted changes on the Settings and you try to go onto a different page, a Dialog may appear asking you to confirm if you want to Commit the Changes, Not Commit the Changes, or Cancel the Action (going to a different page). The option to cancel the action is the same as ignoring the Dialog. And that makes it a Non-modal Dialog.

A Modal is a mode of a UI (commonly that of a Dialog Box) that makes the user's response a requirement. In other words, the user is required to choose an action and there is no option to ignore or dismiss the message.

Example: You've visited an unscrupulous website and a Dialog appears saying you are the one millionth visitor and have won a prize. The only button you could see is “Claim Prize” and clicking anywhere doesn't seem to dismiss the message. And that makes it a Modal Dialog.
